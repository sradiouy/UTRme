# UTRme
UTRme: a tool to annotate UTRme: a scoring based tool to annotate UTR regions in trypanosomatid genomes 

The trypanosomatid linage includes a variety of parasitic protozoans causing a significant worldwide problem burden on human health. Given their peculiar mechanisms of gene expression, these organisms depend on post-transcriptional regulation as the main level of gene expression control. Most signals involved in these regulatory networks are located in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of the mRNAs. To deepen our understanding of gene expression regulation we need to identify these regions with high accuracy. Therefore, we have created UTRme (UTR-mini-exon), a GUI stand-alone application to identify and annotate 5’ and 3’ UTR regions. UTRme implements a multiple scoring system to address the issue of false positive UTR assignment that frequently arise because of the characteristics of the available genomes. The tool offers a way for nonbioinformaticians to precisely determine UTRs from transcriptomic data.
